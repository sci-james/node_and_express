# What are modules in Node js?
### Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.<br>

### A set of functions you want to include in your application.

## Built-in Modules

Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
<br>
Look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp" target=""> Built-in Modules Reference</a> for a complete list of modules.

## Include Modules
To include a module, use the <b>require()</b> function with the name of the module:
<pre>
var http = require('http');</pre>
Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server:<br>
<pre>http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);</pre>
